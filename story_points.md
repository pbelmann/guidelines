# Story Points

## Introduction

We are using story points for estimating the amount and complexity of the work to do in the next sprint.
Thereby it gives us an overview of the scope of work and helps us to optimize and improve our efficiency and velocity.

We give story points by using the fibonacci sequence (1,2,3,5,8,13,21).

## Sizing

The sizing process is done the following way:

1. List all the stories to be sized

2. Put them in order from smallest to largest

- Take the first user story.
- Then take the second user story.
- Decide which is bigger and put the bigger one above.
- Then take the next one and decide where it fits relatively to the other two.
- Then take the next one and do the same.
- Repeat the process until all the stories are now in the list (in a sequence from smallest to largest).

3. Size the stories

- Start from the bottom and give that story a number 2 story points. Giving ‘2’ provides you the room to give a smaller story ‘1’ if discovered at a later stage.

- Look at the next story and decide how big is that story as compared to the first one

- Continue until you have a size on each story

- Use these set of numbers (Fibonacci) while sizing: 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21

## Issues labeled with "investigation"

Thinking tasks or tasks which consist mostly of research, can be labeled with the "investigate" tag.
Especially in the case of issues whose effort is difficult to estimate and where completion can take several sprints, a time constraint can be used to define the time that should be scheduled for this particular task in the current sprint. 
The effort of these tasks is not included in the regular story points.
